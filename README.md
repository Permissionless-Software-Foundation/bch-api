# bch-api

This is a node.js JavaScript REST API server using Express.js. The purpose of this code is to create a REST API server that provides a common interface for working with a Bitcoin Cash full node and various indexers. See [this article](https://troutsblog.com/research/bitcoin-cash/how-to-bch-full-stack-developer) to learn about the 'Cash Stack'. Visit [FullStack.cash](https://fullstack.cash), sign up for a free account, and use this REST API right away with the [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js) JavaScript library.

This repository is intended to be paired with [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js), an npm JavaScript library for building Bitcoin Cash apps.

Both bch-api and bch-js are part of the 'Cash Stack' [full stack of BCH software](https://troutsblog.com/research/bitcoin-cash/how-to-bch-full-stack-developer).

## Features
The following features set this repository apart from rest.bitcoin.com:

- Fine grain access is controlled with a JWT token using
[this back end auth server](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/jwt-bch-api) and [this front end](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/jwt-bch-frontend). Can be used to monetize access to the REST API.
- Typescript removed and ES8 JavaScript used instead.
- npm audit run on all dependencies.

## Live Demo
You can test a live demo of the REST API by running the
[bch-js examples](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js-examples).
Rate limits are 20 requests per minute, but you can increase them to 100 with a [paid account](https://fullstack.cash/pricing).
You can bootstrap your own REST API server by downloading and installing the infrastructure listed on the [CashStrap](https://fullstack.cash/cashstrap) page.

### Configure bch-js
The live servers can be used by [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js) by settings the `restURL` config property to one of these servers:

- BCHN Mainnet REST API server: https://bchn.fullstack.cash/v3/
- ABC Mainnet REST API server: https://abc.fullstack.cash/v3/
- Testnet3 REST API server: https://testnet3.fullstack.cash/v3/
- Check server status: https://metrics.fullstack.cash

## Installation
There are two installation paths, depending if you want a *development* or
*production* environment. You'll also need to set up the underlying infrastructure
described on [this page](https://troutsblog.com/research/bitcoin-cash/how-to-bch-full-stack-developer).

This code targets the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Linux OS.

### Development
This is a standard node.js project. The installation is as follows:

- Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api && cd bch-api`

- Install dependencies:

`npm install`

- Customize the [start-dev-example.sh](start-dev-example.sh) shell script to
point to the required infrastructure. Start the bch-api REST API by running
this script:

`./start-dev-example.sh`

### Production
For a production environment, a Docker container is provided in the
[docker](docker) directory. One for mainnet and one for testnet. Again, these
containers target the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Linux OS.

- Install Docker and Docker Compose by following the commands on
[this Dev Ops page](https://troutsblog.com/research/dev-ops/overview).

- Customize the [bash script](docker/mainnet/start-local-mainnet.sh) for your
installation.

- Build the Docker container with:

`docker-compose build --no-cache`

- Run the Docker container with:

`docker-compose up`
